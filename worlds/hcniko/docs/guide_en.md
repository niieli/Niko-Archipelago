## Installation

1. Download and install [BepInEx 5.4.x](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.22) in your Here Comes Niko root folder. 
2. Start the game once so that BepInEx creates its stuff
3. Download the latest zip from the [release page](https://github.com/niieli/NikoArchipelagoMod/releases/latest) and extract its content into `BepInEx/plugins`

## Connecting

After loading into the game you insert the server address and port, your slot name and a password if necessary in the top left of the game.

Then click 'Connect' and you should load into Home with a blank save. 
(If you already have a save with the same address, port, name and seed, it will load into that one instead)

You can delete Archipelago saves at `...\AppData\LocalLow\Frog Vibes\Here Comes Niko!\Archipelago` (not sure for other systems)
