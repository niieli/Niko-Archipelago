# Here Comes Niko!
WIP
## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure
and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Here Comes Niko! AP Randomizer randomizes every reward(even frogs!) in the game and adds new items which unlock areas and locations.

Areas can only be accessed by finding the corresponding ticket. For example, you need to find the `Turbine Town Ticket` item to access Turbine Town

The goal is to either reach Pepper's interview and get hired or get the Employee Of The Month! achievement. The coin amount required to buy at the Kiosk is randomized

A few changes have been made to the game for a better experience as a randomizer:

- Several requirements for achievements have been toned down.
- Coins and Cassettes stay throughout the game and don't get consumed when purchasing.
